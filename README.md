## To run locally in your SharePoint Workbench
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder
  - run **npm install**
  - run **npm run gulp-trust-dev-cert**
  - Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHAREPOINT_SITE` in serve.json with your sharepoint site
  - run **npm run serve**
    - this should open up a window in the browser called a SharePoint workbench. 
  - To use a.clouddev.laserfiche.com: Open browser dev tools and go to site Local Storage: set 'spDevMode' to true

## To test in a SharePoint site using localhost
- run **npm install**
- **npm run build**
- **npm run package**
- this should result in the creation of a file with the path `/sharepoint/solution/laserfiche-sharepoint-integration.sppkg` from the root folder.
- Navigate to the solution folder
- run **npm run gulp-trust-dev-cert** (one-time only)
- Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHAREPOINT_SITE` in serve.json with your sharepoint site
- run **npm run serve** to host the code for the integration
- reference the [Admin Documentation](https://laserfiche.github.io/laserfiche-sharepoint-integration/docs/admin-documentation) for instructions on how to use the solution file you generated in the first steps to test your changes to the web parts in SharePoint sites.

## To test in a SharePoint site with files hosted by SharePoint
- run **npm install**
- **npm run bundle**
- **npm run package-solution**
- This will create the solution file at /sharepoint/solution/laserfiche-sharepoint-integration.sppkg.
- Once you've built and packaged the solution file, you can use it as a production package and upload it in the SharePoint admin center (see [Admin Docs](https://laserfiche.github.io/laserfiche-sharepoint-integration/docs/admin-documentation))

## To build documentation locally
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to install jekyll and bundler.
    - if any dependency installation fails, try downloading the package manually.
    - navigate to the download directory.
    - run `gem install problematic-dependency-name`, where the last word is replaced by the package you downloaded manually.
    - retry installing the original package now that its dependency is installed.
1. Run `bundle install`  to install all the dependencies needed to serve.
1. Navigate to the `jekyll_files` directory.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the documentation.
1. Open `localhost:4000` in a browser.
