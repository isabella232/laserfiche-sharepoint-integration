# Working with the Laserfiche SharePoint Integration

## Introduction

Laserfiche SharePoint Integration allows you to do two things:

- <b>Browse Laserfiche repository:</b> Sites in SharePoint can use the integration to add a web part which provides a view into the
  Laserfiche cloud repository and to open documents in Laserfiche Web Client. The Repository Explorer web part supports this functionality.

- <b>Save documents to Laserfiche:</b>
  The integration enables users to export files and metadata directly from SharePoint to Laserfiche. The Laserfiche Sign In and Admin
  Configuration web parts support this functionality.

## Guides

- The [Admin Guides](./docs/admin-documentation) explain how to set up the integration, and may require specialized permission.
- The [User Guides](./docs/user-documentation) explain how to use a page with an integration already set up to save documents or browse the Laserfiche repository.

## Important Security Notice

JavaScript code running in same domain/origin as your SharePoint tenant has access to the Laserfiche Integration security token. This token must be kept secure to avoid unauthorized access to Laserfiche systems. To this end, ensure that only trusted code is allowed to run in the same domain/origin.
